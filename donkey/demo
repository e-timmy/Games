I'm wanting to develop a mini-game, kind of donkey-kong style. It should be 2d platformer, with the player beginning at the bottom of the screen, and subsequent platforms and obstacles that spiral up to the top, where the enemy is throwing down balls/barrells that end the game as soon as they collide with the player. For the moment, I want to keep the code simple. So I just want the cascading platforms present as a basis, only one level to begin with, no obstacles and no ball/barrell yet. The player should just be a simple square, that can move left and right, and jump with spacebar. All rendering should be simple for the moment, there will be no use of game sprite pngs, all rendering should happen within the game itself. It should have a retro feel.

Implement this game as specified. Before doing so, restate the requirements as bullet points. Then implement, separating files by their relevant heading. Implement in python, idealy using pygame.
