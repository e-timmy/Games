Next prompt once the character spawning has been dealt with:

I need some help with an RPG I'm developing in python using pygame. The relevant code (at least what I have deemed as relevant) is pasted below. Add the following mechanics:

- For the monster in the given quadrant of the map, make a larger version that exists within the boss arena for the given quadrant.
- Alter the quadrants so that they have the following order: top-right = spring, bottom-right=summer, bottom-left=autumn, top-left=winter.
- Remove the forest that allows access between the top-left and top-right quadrants.

Implement these three things, for any class altered, replace back in full, under subheadings separated by the given file.


Then think about structuring each quadrant.

Talking to npcs?

Danger from enemies.

Maybe replace hero sprite with one which can have sword/pickup items?
