Again, neither of the problems were solved. If the ball resets, the the score should tick. Print to console when updating, with the measures before and after.
The hardcoded AI still doesn't respond after the first game if they are playing first. So the ball spawns, and the hardcoded AI doesn't move, if the other player is
first, and hits the ball back, then the hardcoded AI does get into the action.
It seems as though both problems are tied to the restarting of the game. Debug and solve accordingly.
