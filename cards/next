Model A:
- Cards and hud still overlapping.
- Endgame messages should fade in and out in more subtle manner.
- Cards should clear at end of game (slide back into deck)


Model B:
- There is room for each element but remains a little bit crowded.
- Cards need to be cleared at end of game.
- Money shouldn't reset. Player should be informed of how much won or lost.

Extras:
- rather than number of chips, should be stacked up
- on latter point, perspective should be less over the top of the table and more from an angle, to see the stacks
- when winning, chips sliding into player's totals.
- Cards should clear at end of game (slide back into deck)
- shuffle animation for deck before dealing.
